# companion
A web app for sharing geotagged photos and messages.  It consists of a Nodejs webserver w/ a REST API and 
an Android application.  The Android application provides a means of sending geo-tagged text and photos to
the server which plots the content on an interactive, in-browser map using Google Map's JavaScript API.

## Backstory
Fours years of grinding out a Computer Engineering degree at the University of Minnesota had me beyond restless.
I spent (dare I say) hundreds of hours debugging ill-fated analog circuits and highly(?)-parallelized C code in windowless labs. 
Understandably, in a moment of instability, I booked myself a one-way ticket to Hanoi, VietNam set to depart hardly a week after my 
graduation date.  I would be end up spending the following 50+ days backpacking solo across VietNam, northern Thailand, 
Malaysia, and Hawaii.  Needless to say, my family was gravely concerned for my safety. But, simultanesouly, they were quite curious.  
They wanted to keep an eye on me and also share in this experience of a lifetime. Thus, in the weeks leading up to my 
depature (amidst my final final exams as an undergrad), *companion* was born!
